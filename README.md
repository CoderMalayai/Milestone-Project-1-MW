Rock, Paper, Scissors game

Inspiration for Game:

The main inspiration for my game was a simple game to play here and there. Very simple, clean , and clear. what I mean by those things are that I didn't wanna put too much on the screen to distract from the actual game. I didn't have a clear vision on what I wanted, but it all came together at the end.

How to Play Rock, Paper, Scissors:

The game is typically played between two people but in this game you will be playing against the computer. Each player will pick one of the following images indicating rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The first to five wins.

Technologies Used to Build the Game:

I used languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used these languages to both build the frontend and backend of my browser game. My backend is handling game logic, player interactions. My Rock, Paper, Scissors were made by me using www.Pixilart.com.

Outstanding Bugs or Unfinished Functionality:

1) I ensured that the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors are correctly implemented into my game.
2) I checked for any issues with buttons, input fields, or display elements. Never really saw a big bug or anything, broke my code here and there but no bugs.
3) I would love to make it able to have 2 players go against each other in the future.
4) For this game I see it becoming more challenging and I wannna make it harder as we go further.
5) I have wanted to add a  full screen saying that "this" player has won then play again.
6) I do wanna add sound to my game like paper ripping and rocks dropping, I honestly tried doing it but all the audio I have found I had to pay and get it. 
7) What really helped me alot was youtube tutorials by https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez -
Videos I watched to help me with functions, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKdQx-SZ5A and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1_vHArDBRA&t=131s .
